I develop computational strategies to translate large amounts of data into biological knowledge. I'm interested in the analysis of multi-omics data to discover gene targets and to understand the mechanism of action of new drugs. In order to ensure reproducibility of results, I implement my analyses in documented workflows, software packages and graphic interfaces. I am a contributor of software to the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) project.
