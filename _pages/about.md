I develop computational strategies to translate large amounts of data into biological knowledge. I am interested in (1) understanding how transcript isoforms contribute to cellular phenotypes and disease conditions and (2) integrating multi-omic data to unravel molecular cancer phenotypes. In order to ensure reproducibility of results, I implement my analyses in documented workflows, software packages and graphic interphases. I am a contributor of software to the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) project.
