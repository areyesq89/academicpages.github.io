I am postdoctoral research fellow in the [Rafael Irizarry's laboratory](https://rafalab.github.io/) at the [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org/) and the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/). Before joining the lab, I studied a genomics undergrad in the [Center for Genomic Sciences](http://www.ccg.unam.mx/en) and did my PhD at the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://www.embl.de/)) under the supervision of [Wolfgang Huber](https://www.embl.de/research/units/genome_biology/huber/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60002619).

My research is focused on developing computational strategies that enable the translation of large amounts of data into biological knowledge. Broadly, I am interested in (1) understanding processes by which transcript isoforms contribute to cellular phenotypes and disease conditions and (2) integrating multi-omic data to unravel molecular cancer phenotypes. In order to ensure reproducibility of results and effective dissemination of code, I implement my analyses in documented workflows, software packages and graphic interphases.
