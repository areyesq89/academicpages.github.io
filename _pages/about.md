I'm a data scientist currently working for the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Basel, Switzerland. I develop computational strategies to translate large amounts of data into biological knowledge. I'm interested in the analysis of multi-omics data to discover novel gene targets and to understand the mechanism of action of new drugs. I implement my analyses in documented reproducible workflows, software packages and graphic interfaces. I am a contributor of software to the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) project. The content of this website represents my own views.
