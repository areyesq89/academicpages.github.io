I am postdoctoral research fellow in [Rafael Irizarry's laboratory](https://rafalab.github.io/) at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org/) and [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/). I have an undergraduate degree in genomics from the [Center for Genomic Sciences](http://www.ccg.unam.mx/en), UNAM, and a PhD in bioinformatics from the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://www.embl.de/), where I worked under the supervision of [Wolfgang Huber](https://www.embl.de/research/units/genome_biology/huber/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60002619).

I develop computational strategies to translate large amounts of data into biological knowledge. I am interested in (1) understanding how transcript isoforms contribute to cellular phenotypes and disease conditions and (2) integrating multi-omic data to unravel molecular cancer phenotypes. In order to ensure reproducibility of results, I implement my analyses in documented workflows, software packages and graphic interphases. I contribute to the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) project.
